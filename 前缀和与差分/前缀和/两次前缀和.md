# Karen and Coffee

## 题面翻译

Karen 喜欢咖啡。  
她有  $n$ 本食谱，第  $i$ 本食谱包含两个数  $l_i,r_i$，表示这本食谱推荐用  $[l_i,r_i]$ 之间的温度（包含  $l_i.r_i$）来煮咖啡。  
Karen 认为一个温度  $a$ 是可接受的**当且仅当**有  $\ge k$ 本食谱推荐用  $a$ 来煮咖啡。  
Karen 有  $q$ 个问题，每个问题用一对正整数  $a_i,b_i$ 来表示，表示她问  $[a_i,b_i]$ 之间有多少个温度是**可接受的**。

## 题目描述

To stay woke and attentive during classes, Karen needs some coffee!

 ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF816B/84ca24fa194ecce1cb9c3e825b543dfb7809c444.png)Karen, a coffee aficionado, wants to know the optimal temperature for brewing the perfect cup of coffee. Indeed, she has spent some time reading several recipe books, including the universally acclaimed "The Art of the Covfefe".

She knows $ n $ coffee recipes. The $ i $ -th recipe suggests that coffee should be brewed between $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ degrees, inclusive, to achieve the optimal taste.

Karen thinks that a temperature is admissible if at least $ k $ recipes recommend it.

Karen has a rather fickle mind, and so she asks $ q $ questions. In each question, given that she only wants to prepare coffee with a temperature between $ a $ and $ b $ , inclusive, can you tell her how many admissible integer temperatures fall within the range?

## 输入格式

The first line of input contains three integers, $ n $ , $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=n<=200000 $ ), and $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=200000 $ ), the number of recipes, the minimum number of recipes a certain temperature must be recommended by to be admissible, and the number of questions Karen has, respectively.

The next $ n $ lines describe the recipes. Specifically, the $ i $ -th line among these contains two integers $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ ( $ 1<=l_{i}<=r_{i}<=200000 $ ), describing that the $ i $ -th recipe suggests that the coffee be brewed between $ l_{i} $ and $ r_{i} $ degrees, inclusive.

The next $ q $ lines describe the questions. Each of these lines contains $ a $ and $ b $ , ( $ 1<=a<=b<=200000 $ ), describing that she wants to know the number of admissible integer temperatures between $ a $ and $ b $ degrees, inclusive.

## 输出格式

For each question, output a single integer on a line by itself, the number of admissible integer temperatures between $ a $ and $ b $ degrees, inclusive.

## 提示

In the first test case, Karen knows $ 3 $ recipes.

1. The first one recommends brewing the coffee between $ 91 $ and $ 94 $ degrees, inclusive.
2. The second one recommends brewing the coffee between $ 92 $ and $ 97 $ degrees, inclusive.
3. The third one recommends brewing the coffee between $ 97 $ and $ 99 $ degrees, inclusive.

A temperature is admissible if at least $ 2 $ recipes recommend it.

She asks $ 4 $ questions.

In her first question, she wants to know the number of admissible integer temperatures between $ 92 $ and $ 94 $ degrees, inclusive. There are $ 3 $ : $ 92 $ , $ 93 $ and $ 94 $ degrees are all admissible.

In her second question, she wants to know the number of admissible integer temperatures between $ 93 $ and $ 97 $ degrees, inclusive. There are $ 3 $ : $ 93 $ , $ 94 $ and $ 97 $ degrees are all admissible.

In her third question, she wants to know the number of admissible integer temperatures between $ 95 $ and $ 96 $ degrees, inclusive. There are none.

In her final question, she wants to know the number of admissible integer temperatures between $ 90 $ and $ 100 $ degrees, inclusive. There are $ 4 $ : $ 92 $ , $ 93 $ , $ 94 $ and $ 97 $ degrees are all admissible.

In the second test case, Karen knows $ 2 $ recipes.

1. The first one, "wikiHow to make Cold Brew Coffee", recommends brewing the coffee at exactly $ 1 $ degree.
2. The second one, "What good is coffee that isn't brewed at at least $ 36.3306 $ times the temperature of the surface of the sun?", recommends brewing the coffee at exactly $ 200000 $ degrees.

A temperature is admissible if at least $ 1 $ recipe recommends it.

In her first and only question, she wants to know the number of admissible integer temperatures that are actually reasonable. There are none.



## 思路：

食谱推荐：首先我们需要将l-r这个区间内都进行+1，这时我们可以想到差分，然后对差分数组进行前缀和求和。可以得到每一个温度所占的点数，然后我们再使用前缀和思想，若每一个点的点数>=k，那么我们就让ans数组+1，其中，`ans[i]`代表的是`1-i`这个温度区间有多少个题目满足的答案，而`s[i]`代表的是有多少个食谱推荐使用该温度，`g[i]`代表的是差分数组

所以本题是用了两次前缀和操作，很有意义的一道题目。

##  代码：

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;
int g[200005], s[200005], ans[200005];
int n, k, q;
int l, r, a, b;
int main()
{
	ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
	cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);
	cin >> n >> k >> q;
	while (n--) {
		cin >> l >> r;
		g[l]++; g[r + 1]--;
	}
	for (int i = 1; i <= 200001; i++) {
		s[i] = s[i - 1] + g[i];
		if (s[i] >= k) ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + 1;
		else ans[i] = ans[i - 1];
	}
	while (q--) {
		cin >> a >> b;
		cout << ans[b] - ans[a - 1] << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
```
